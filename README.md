App builded to practice concepts like: 
- navigation
- redux store, actions, reducers
- redux hooks like useDispatch, useSelector
- react hooks like useState, useRef, useEffect, useCallback
- Write, read and uptate data stored in Firebase and also authenticate user with email-password method
- Field form states handling with useReducer instead of useState
- Auto login to avoid user to type credentials, based on token expiration provided by Firebase


In this app an authenticated user would see a list of products to buy after adding it to his cart (view) and generate a buy order (another view) or just to check the product detail.
An "Administrator" option to either create or update products and a logout button to navigate back to authentication view
